                [ ] Match anything inside the square brackets for ONE character position once and only once, for example, [12] means match the target to 1 and if that does not match then match the target to 2 while [0123456789] means match to any character in the range 0 to 9.

                - The - (dash) inside square brackets is the 'range separator' and allows us to define a range, in our example above of [0123456789] we could rewrite it as [0-9]. You can define more than one range inside a list, for example, [0-9A-C] means check for 0 to 9 and A to C (but not a to c). NOTE: To test for - inside brackets (as a literal) it must come first or last, that is, [-0-9] will test for - and 0 to 9.

                ^ The ^ (circumflex or caret) inside square brackets negates the expression (we will see an alternate use for the circumflex/caret outside square brackets later), for example, [^Ff] means anything except upper or lower case F

                () The ( (open parenthesis) and ) (close parenthesis) may be used to group (or bind) parts of our search expression together. Officially this is called a subexpression (a.k.a. a submatch or group) and subexpressions may be nested to any depth. Parentheses (subexpresions) also capture the matched element into a variable that may be used as a backreference.

                | The | (vertical bar or pipe) is called alternation in techspeak and means find the left hand OR right values, for example, gr(a|e)y will find 'gray' or 'grey' and has the sense that - having found the literal characters 'gr' - if the first test is not valid (a) the second will be tried (e), if the first is valid the second will not be tried. Alternation can be nested within each expression, thus gr((a|e)|i)y will find 'gray', 'grey' and 'griy'.
